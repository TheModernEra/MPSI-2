# What is MPSI 2?
MPSI 2 is a native macOS app for installing the Oculus Quest game "Pavlov: Shack"

# What are the requirements?
The app will only run on macOS 10.12 and higher. I tried to get lower compatibility working but the file management framework I'm using only supports 10.12 and above.

# How do I use it?
1. Go to https://github.com/TheModernEra/MPSI-2/releases
2. Under the latest version at the top of the page, click "Assets"
3. Click "MPSI.2.zip" to download the app.
4. Double-click "MPSI.2.zip" in Finder
5. Right click "MPSI 2.app", then click "Open"
