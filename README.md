# What are the requirements?
The app will only run on macOS 10.12 and higher. I tried to get lower compatibility working but the file management framework I'm using only supports 10.12 and above.

# How do I use it?
1. Go to https://github.com/TheModernEra/MPSI-2/releases
2. Under the latest version at the top of the page, click "Assets"
3. Click "MPSI.2.zip" to download the app.
4. Double-click "MPSI.2.zip" in Finder
5. Right click "MPSI 2.app", then click "Open"

# FAQ
I can't open MPSI! It says something about malware?

It won't let you open the app because I would have to pay $100 for verification, which I don't have the means for. If macOS won't let you open the app, open System Preferences, click "Security and Privacy", then click "Open Anyway" at the bottom. I promise there is no malware, because I don't have the technical knowledge to implement it.

When I pressed "Install Game", MPSI got stuck at "Beginning game installation"!

99.99% of the time, this is due to the cable not providing a sufficient connection to the Quest. Unplug and replug the cable, switch up the port it's plugged into, or use a different cable.

The installation is stuck on "Pushing OBB!"

This part does take a while, and the speed really depends on your cable. On average for me, it takes around 3-4 minutes. I would say give it a maximum of 10 minutes before pressing "Command + Q" in MPSI and restarting the procedure. If it gets stuck multiple times, try a different cable.

The download is stuck on "Downloading game files!"

Rarely, the download API I used just doesn't like to work. MPSI supports using previously downloaded game files, as long as they are the latest version, zipped with the default name, and stored in the "Downloads" Folder
